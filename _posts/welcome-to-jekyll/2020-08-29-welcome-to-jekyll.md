Being a contractor is probably the most lucrative career path in the Nordics. When I jumped ship from my last salaried job in early 2018, I instantly bumped my per-hour compensation by over 100%. Having this much of a buffer, I threw in a final request while negotiating my first solo contract:

”Oh, by the way, due to family obligations I’ll be available between 9-15:30, give or take 30 minutes. Is that ok?”

The client hemmed and hawed but finally agreed to it. Thus began my journey into the world of 6 hour days.
